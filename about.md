## My journey 

I’m not a privacy guru. I’m a software engineer who got fed up with how much of our digital lives are tracked, sold, and exploited — and decided to do something about it.

This space is a way for me to document and share what I am learning and utilizing:
🔐 How to take back control of my data
📱 Practical ways to pluck out big tech from my phone and my life
🕵🏽‍♂️ How to move through the internet a little more quietly

## What I realized?

As I began my own journey, I noticed that most privacy advice was either meant for high-risk individuals and called for completely leaving mainstream platforms, or it only offered surface-level tips - helpful in the short term, but not enough to build lasting, sustainable privacy habits.

## What I want to provide

This space is meant to be a place for learning out loud, for small digital rebellions, and for helping everyday users push back against all kinds of tracking and surveillance, one step at a time.

**It’s not about going full tin-foil hat. It’s about knowing what’s watching you, and choosing when (or if) you want to be seen.**

So if you’ve ever felt creeped out by how well your phone knows you...
If you’ve ever wondered how much Facebook actually has on you...
Or if you just want to make your digital life a little more yours again —
You’re in the right place.

No shame. No judgment. No jargon.
Just a slow, intentional exit from the machine.
