## My journey 

I’m not a privacy guru. I’m a software engineer who got fed up with how much of our digital lives are tracked, sold, and exploited.

As I began my own journey, I noticed that most privacy advice fell into two extremes. It was either aimed at high-risk individuals and required completely leaving mainstream platforms, or it offered surface-level tips.

## What I want to provide

This space is for learning out loud, for small digital rebellions, and for helping everyday users push back against digital tracking and surveillance by building lasting, sustainable privacy habits.

The content here focuses on:

🔐 How to take back control of your data<br>
📱 Practical ways to remove Big Tech from your phone and life<br>
🕵🏽‍♂️ How to move through the internet a little more quietly<br>

**It’s not about going full tin-foil hat. It’s about knowing what’s watching you, and choosing when (or if) you want to be seen.**

So if you’ve ever felt creeped out by how well your phone knows you...if you’ve ever wondered how much Facebook actually has on you...or if you just want to make your digital life a little more yours again - you’re in the right place.

No shame. No judgment. No jargon.
Just a slow, intentional exit from the machine.
