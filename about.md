I’m not a privacy guru. I’m a software engineer who got fed up with how much of our digital lives are tracked, sold, and exploited — and decided to do something about it.

This space started as a way to document what I was learning:
🔐 How to take back control of my data.
📱 How to de-Google my phone.
🕵🏽‍♂️ How to move through the internet a little more quietly.

What I realized?
Most “privacy” advice is either buried in technical jargon or feels totally out of reach for regular people.

That’s where the.redacted.user comes in —
a place for learning out loud,
for small digital rebellions,
and for helping everyday users push back against surveillance, one step at a time.

It’s not about going full tin-foil hat.
It’s about knowing what’s watching you, and choosing when (or if) you want to be seen.

So if you’ve ever felt creeped out by how well your phone knows you...
If you’ve ever wondered how much Facebook actually has on you...
Or if you just want to make your digital life a little more yours again —
You’re in the right place.

No shame. No judgment. No jargon.
Just a slow, intentional exit from the machine.
