# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): What They Do and What They Don‚Äôt

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) are often mentioned as a quick fix for online privacy. But what do they actually protect you from? And what are their limits?

If you are curious about privacy or just want to better protect your data online, here is a breakdown of what VPNs actually help with, and what they do not.

## ‚úÖ What VPNs Do
### 1. Protect Your Data from Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

When you connect to the internet without a VPN, your internet service provider (ISP) can see the websites you visit and when you visit them. While most ISPs may not actively monitor or monetize your browsing, they can. And that‚Äôs enough reason to be cautious.

VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and tunnel it through a secure server, hiding your browsing activity from your ISP. This helps prevent your data from becoming a monetizable ‚Äúuser profile‚Äù used for ad targeting or sold to third parties.

### 2. Hide Your IP Address from Websites

When you access a website, your device shares its IP address, essentially your online ‚Äúhome address‚Äù. A VPN masks your real IP by showing the IP of the VPN server instead.

This means...

* Your IP-related location (like city or region) is protected
* Your home network is protected from being tied to your identity
* You can access content that may be blocked or restricted in your region

### 3. Encrypt Traffic on Public WiFi

Before diving into VPN protection, it's helpful to understand the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

* **HTTP** stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the basic system your browser uses to communicate with websites. However, it does not encrypt any of that communication. This means anyone on the same network can potentially see what pages you visit and even intercept data you send.

* **HTTPS** adds a layer of encryption. This protects your sensitive data from being read by outsiders, especially on public networks. Most modern websites use HTTPS by default, but not all.

Now, even when a website uses HTTPS, someone on public WiFi might still be able to see the website address you are connecting to since that part is not encrypted with **HTTPS**.

This is where a VPN comes in. A VPN encrypts all of your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server. This means no one on the same network ‚Äî not even the WiFi owner ‚Äî can see what websites you're visiting or what data you are sending.

It is like putting your entire internet session inside a secure tunnel, keeping your online activity private and protected.

## üö´ What VPNs Don‚Äôt Do

Despite all the buzz, VPNs aren‚Äôt magic wands. They have clear limitations, especially if you‚Äôre aiming for complete anonymity or privacy.

* A VPN hides your data from your internet provider and others on the network, but not from the VPN provider itself. You are shifting trust from your ISP to your VPN. The provider can see your activity unless it has a strict no-logs policy. Even then, trust and independent audits are important.

* VPNs do not make you completely anonymous. While they hide your IP, they do not hide your behavior. If you log into accounts or use the same usernames or email addresses, websites can still identify you.

* VPNs do not stop browser-based tracking. Things like cookies, browser fingerprinting, and embedded trackers can still follow you. To block those, you will need extra tools like privacy-focused browsers and extensions.

## The Bottom Line

A VPN is a strong layer of protection. It encrypts your traffic, hides your IP address, and keeps your internet provider from seeing your browsing activity. But it will not make you invisible, and it will not protect you from every type of tracking.

It is also important to choose a trusted VPN provider. Since all your internet traffic runs through it, you want to be sure it is not becoming the tracker you are trying to avoid. If a VPN is completely free, chances are you are the product.

If privacy matters to you, think of a VPN as just one tool in a broader digital hygiene kit, not a complete solution.
